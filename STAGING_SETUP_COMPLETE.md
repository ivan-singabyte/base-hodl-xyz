# ‚úÖ Staging Environment Setup Complete!

## What's Been Set Up

### 1. Git Branch Structure
- **`main` branch**: Production (protected, requires PR approval)
- **`staging` branch**: Staging (direct push for approved contributors)

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- **Production**: https://base-hodl.xyz (Base Mainnet)
- **Staging**: https://base-hodl-staging.vercel.app (Base Sepolia)

### 3. Contributor Access
Approved contributors can now:
- Push directly to `staging` branch without PR approval
- See automatic deployments to staging environment
- Test with Base Sepolia testnet

## üéØ Next Steps for You

### 1. Configure Vercel Dashboard

Go to the Vercel dashboard and configure both projects:

#### For Staging Project (base-hodl-staging):
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/ivan-singabytes-projects/base-hodl-staging/settings/git
2. Set **Production Branch** to: `staging`
3. Enable automatic deployments for `staging` branch

#### For Production Project (base-hodl-xyz):
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/ivan-singabytes-projects/base-hodl-xyz/settings/git
2. Keep **Production Branch** as: `main`
3. DO NOT enable staging branch there

### 2. Add Contributors to GitHub

Give approved contributors push access to the repository:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ivan-singabyte/base-hodl-xyz/settings/access
2. Add contributors as collaborators
3. They'll have push access to `staging` branch

### 3. Branch Protection (Optional)

Protect the `main` branch:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ivan-singabyte/base-hodl-xyz/settings/branches
2. Add branch protection rule for `main`
3. Require PR reviews before merging
4. Leave `staging` unprotected for direct pushes
